# Introduction to Agile Methodology 🏃‍♂️⚙️

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### Waterfall Model
**Flow:**
Requirement Analysis → Designing → Coding → Testing → Deployment

**Limitations:**
- Not suitable for large or complex projects
- High cost of rework
- Requirement volatility (changes are difficult to handle)

## Agile Methodology

Agile breaks the **requirements into multiple modules** and follows a **timeboxed, iterative approach** to deliver working software incrementally from early stages.

| Comparison        | Agile                 | Waterfall              |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Deployment Cycle | Weeks / Days         | Months / Quarters     |
| Deployment Mode  | Feature / Requirement| All or None            |
| Response to Change | Quick               | Slow                   |

## Core Values of Agile (Agile Manifesto ✅)
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Principles of Agile
1. Highest priority: **customer satisfaction** through early and continuous delivery
2. Deliver working software **frequently** (weeks to months)
3. Business people and developers must **work together daily**
4. Working software is the **primary measure of progress**
5. Focus on **technical excellence** and **simplicity**

## Flavors of Agile
1. **Scrum**
   - Timeboxed method with defined roles, events, and artifacts
   - Best suited for **development projects**
2. **Kanban**
   - Visualizes and prioritizes workflow
   - Suited for **maintenance and support projects**
3. **Extreme Programming (XP)**
   - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
   - Pair programming
   - Refactoring
   - Continuous Integration (CI)
4. **Lean**
   - Applied mainly in manufacturing & software
   - Eliminates **waste** and improves flow efficiency
